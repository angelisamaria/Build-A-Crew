Research:
* Pick 1 (maybe 2) essential, but easy to test APIs
* Test API by browsing the documentation and using the code snippets to make requests/view the response data.
* Check LinkedIn API first for user data, seems more relevant
* Keep researching apps that are similar to yours. They'll provide some insight and inspiration!

I'll email more information about messaging/chat options. But stay focused on the MVP and researching the APIs at this stage. The more we can confirm feature wise, the easier implementation will be.
